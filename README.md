# Hi, I’m Daksh

I’m a second-year Computer Science student at Royal Holloway, University of London, seeking a Software Engineering placement for 2026–27. I’m open to roles based in the UK or remote.

I build real-world software projects with a focus on problem-solving, clear application logic, and reliable code. My experience comes from hands-on development involving APIs, data modelling, and complete development workflows rather than coursework alone.

### Projects
- **[Reclaim](https://github.com/dakshkumar96/Reclaim)** A habit-tracking web application built with React and Flask, using PostgreSQL for data storage and OpenAI integration to support adaptive recommendations, gamified challenges, and streak tracking.

- **[Smart Meal](https://github.com/dakshkumar96/SmartMeal)** A Python and Flask application that generates budget-aware weekly meal plans by filtering recipe data and automating cost calculations, reducing meal planning time from ~45 minutes to ~10 minutes.

- **[Skill Snacks](https://github.com/dakshkumar96/SkillSnacks)** A responsive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring structured content delivery and client-side progress tracking.

### Technical skills
- **Languages:** Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL (PostgreSQL), C/C++  
- **Frameworks & libraries:** React, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Development:** Git/GitHub, SDLC, unit testing, object-oriented programming

### Problem-solving
I actively practise algorithmic problem-solving and have solved **100+ LeetCode problems** and **50+ Project Euler problems**, strengthening my ability to reason about edge cases, efficiency, and correctness.
